A hash table is just a way of storing data
so it can be retreived quickly.

A hash code is a number which is unique
to the item in the table. If something
has the same hash code then it must
be the same. This code is used to generate
the array index of the item in the table
we take the hash code and divide it by
the size of the array then the remainder
is the array index.

To avoid the clashing of indexing we
tend to use prime numbers for the size of
an array

Every object has a hashCode which should
generate a distinct hash code for it.
